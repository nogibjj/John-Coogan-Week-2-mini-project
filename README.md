[![Test workflow for Python template](https://github.com/johncoogan53/PythonDataScience/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev&event=push)](https://github.com/johncoogan53/PythonDataScience/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)

## This is a workflow for a python script which performs descriptive statistics on a csv file
### This project has the following dependencies:
* ruff == 0.0.278
* pytest == 7.4.2
* black == 23.7.0
* pandas == 2.0.3
* nbval == 0.10.0
* matplotlib == 3.7.2

### This project uses has functions defined in a lib.py for reading a csv and generating summary statistics (with appropriate error handling) and a script with associated jupyter notebook for visualizing that data.

### This workflow will perform the following actions on any push to a branch in this repository:
* Establish a virtual environment for python3
* Install the dependencies listed above
* Lint the pushed code with ruff
* Format with black
* (a test has yet to be implemented)


### Below is the output from the script/jupyter notebook which gives the count,mean,std,min, quartiles, and max for each variable:

### Below is the result of the visualize function from the script which plots vehicle weight against mpg.

### This is the front end of a potential CD pipeline which will quality control continuously developed code into a deployment environment. Future iterations will build on this baseline best practice and scale into projects of higher complexity.
